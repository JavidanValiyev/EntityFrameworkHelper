# EfCore Helper Context

If you are working on projects that contain multi-tenant, auditable or soft deletable tables,
So you had add  ``` && TenantId=={someValue} ``` or  ```&& !IsDeleted ``` conditions or something like that to all of your entity framework core queries.
Sometime this is hard to manage all of this queries, especially large project that contain big amount of query.
If you or your teammate forget to add these condition to queries. You may be in trouble. ðŸ¤£
